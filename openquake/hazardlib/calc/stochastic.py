    Generates a 'Stochastic Event Set' (that is a collection of earthquake
    ruptures) representing a possible *realization* of the seismicity as
    described by a source model.

    The calculator loops over sources. For each source, it loops over ruptures.
    For each rupture, the number of occurrence is randomly sampled by
    calling
    :meth:`openquake.hazardlib.source.rupture.BaseProbabilisticRupture.sample_number_of_occurrences`

    .. note::
        This calculator is using random numbers. In order to reproduce the
        same results numpy random numbers generator needs to be seeded, see
        http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.seed.html

    :param sources:
        An iterator of seismic sources objects (instances of subclasses
        of :class:`~openquake.hazardlib.source.base.BaseSeismicSource`).
    :param sites:
        A list of sites to consider (or None)
    :param source_site_filter:

    :param source_site_filter:

    :returns:
        Generator of :class:`~openquake.hazardlib.source.rupture.Rupture`
        objects that are contained in an event set. Some ruptures can be
        missing from it, others can appear one or more times in a row.
